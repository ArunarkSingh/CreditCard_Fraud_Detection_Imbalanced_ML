# Credit Card Fraud Detection under Extreme Class Imbalance

**Arunark Singh**

---

## Overview

This project builds and evaluates a **credit card fraud detection pipeline** under **extreme class imbalance**, where fraudulent transactions represent less than 0.2% of the data.

Rather than optimizing for misleading accuracy metrics, the focus is on **proper evaluation**, **precision–recall tradeoffs**, and **validation-based threshold tuning** to prioritize fraud recall in realistic screening scenarios.

---

## Key Objectives

- Handle extreme class imbalance responsibly
- Evaluate models beyond accuracy using ROC and Precision–Recall analysis
- Tune the decision threshold based on validation data
- Demonstrate realistic fraud-screening tradeoffs
